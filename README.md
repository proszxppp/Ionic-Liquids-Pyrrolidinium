# Ionic-Liquids-Pyrrolidinium

The current folder contains the parameter files for ions simulated in our recent paper on charge and vdW scaling of pyrrolidinium ionic liquids. 

The cations belong to the pyrrolidinium family featuring a saturated five-membered ring with two alkyl substitutions at the quaternary ammonium center. The lengths of the alkyl chains ranges from 3 to 10, corresponding to [3MP], [4MP] ... [DMP] cations. 
The anion is a relatively well-studied molecule named [NTF]. 

The parameters of ions are grabbed from molecule-specific RESP fitting and the GAFF2 transferable force field. Two ab initio levels are considered. The first one is the traditional gas-phase HF/6-31G*, while the other higher-level method is B3LYP/def2-QZVPP with IEFPCM implciit solvent as a more accurate up-to-date selection. 

For researchers preferring the .mol2 format, please send requests to the leading author who parametrizes the systems. 

In our paper, cross-comparison ESP analysis and molecular simulations with the two charge sets are performed to investigate the degree of similarities of the two charge sets, and no significant difference is observed, confirming the reliability of the traditional gas-phase HF/6-31G* selection in molecular modelling of ionic liquids.
